Brainstorm some todo items.

Create Board class.
	For starters let it be strictly 8 x 8 but consider flexible board size.
	
	Methods:
		clear() - remove all pieces from the board
		reset() - reset pieces to some initial state (how to designate initial state?)
		print() - print representation of current board with pieces

Create GameState class.
	Methods:
		whoseTurn() - who's turn is it
		getBoard() - get board object with pieces
		print() - print board (from Board object) and gameState info (whose turn and other?)
